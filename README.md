This project implements an AI-powered system to detect and classify animals in farm images into wild, domestic, or no animal categories. A custom dataset, manually collected and annotated using Label Studio, forms the foundation of the model training. Multiple architectures, including AlexNet-MCNN, YOLOv8, and YOLOv11, were evaluated, with a YOLO-based ensemble model achieving the best performance. The system incorporates techniques like stratified dataset splitting, Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), and Soft-NMS to ensure high accuracy, precision, and recall. Designed for scalability, it is prepared for future integration with real-time alert mechanisms to help farmers prevent crop damage effectively
